Example: "Led the design for the new notification service (link)."

Example: "My designs have focused on single components, not complex systems spanning multiple services. I need to demonstrate the ability to handle ambiguity at the system level."

Example: "Volunteer to write the architecture doc for the upcoming Q3 cross-team project. Schedule design reviews with principal engineers for feedback on long-term scalability."

Scope & Ambiguity

Independently defines and solves ambiguous business and technical problems. Creates scope for themselves and others by identifying unowned, high-impact problems.    

Leadership & Influence (Force Multiplication)

Acts as a force multiplier for the team. Formally mentors junior engineers, improves team-wide processes (e.g., CI/CD, testing frameworks), and influences the technical direction of partner teams.    

Business & Customer Impact

Connects technical decisions to business objectives and customer needs. Makes data-driven trade-off decisions and can articulate the "why" behind the work to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.    

Operational Excellence

Leads the charge on improving the operational posture of the team's services. Drives initiatives to improve monitoring, reduce operational load, and resolve the root cause of recurring issues.    

Hiring & Developing Talent

Actively participates in hiring and is a formal mentor for new hires or interns. Is accountable for the technical growth of others and contributes to raising the team's overall talent bar.  1
